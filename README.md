## 🧐 Student Marks Analysis Project

This mini project demonstrates basic **Data Analysis and Data Cleaning** skills using **pandas** and **NumPy**.

In this notebook:
- 📋 Created a synthetic dataset of student marks in three subjects
- 🧹 Handled missing values cleanly
- 📈 Calculated each student's average marks
- 🏆 Identified the top scorer
- 🎨 Visualized the data using bar plots and box plots

**Skills Practiced:**  
- pandas DataFrame operations (creation, exploration, manipulation)  
- NumPy array operations (mean calculation)  
- Data Cleaning (handling missing data)  
- Data Visualization (basic plots)
